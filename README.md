# Summary of all my code.

This repo aims to run [scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc) on all of my repositories and generate a dataset for the evolution of things I am working on.

## Approach

The general approach is to run ssc to generate data once all of the repositories have been cloned.

The repositories are cloned with a python script using the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
